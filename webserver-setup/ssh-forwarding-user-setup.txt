1. SSH into "ssh-port-forwarding-bastion-server" as ec2-user

2.  Create a new linux user "ssh-web-access". 
    sudo adduser ssh-web-access

3.  Switch the context to the newly created user. 
    sudo su - ssh-web-access


4.  Create a new directory ".ssh" and set appropriate permissions 
    a. mkdir .ssh
    b. chmod 700 .ssh

5.  To register new ssh key pair (authorized keys) and set appropriate permissions.
    a. touch .ssh/authorized_keys
    b. chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

6.  Generate a key pair and save the key pair from the your personal host
    ssh-keygen -t rsa

7.  Upload the public key into the "ssh-port-forwarding-bastion-server" into /home/ssh-web-access/.ssh/

8.  Merge the contents of the public key into "authorized_keys" file
    cd /home/ssh-web-access/.ssh
    cat <public-key-name> >> authorized_keys

9.  Change the settings of authorized_keys file to be 400 on "ssh-port-forwarding-bastion-server"
    chmod 400 authorized_keys

10. Try ssh-ing from your personal instance/host to "ssh-port-forwarding-bastion-server" as the user "ssh-web-access" using the key generated. Expected outcome is that login using a new session as "ssh-web-access" should be established. 
     ssh -i <key-name> ssh-web-access@<public-dns-name>
